          <p>The world of Terra is a creative worldbuilding project I have been developing for the past two years. Broadly, this worldbuilding project is the culmination of my many writing projects, personal interests, and creative exercises given visual form. In a way, Terra is the first of many platforms I intend to make to share my work. I am inspired by media, history, and endless imagination. So, it is in this tiny space that I'd like to share some of what I have created with you.</p>

          <p>In Terra there are 6 continents. But in the world map above only 4 are shown. Technically speaking, I haven't even finished everything that is on the aforementioned map. (Hey, I never said this project was finished!) These two nameless continents exist on the otherside of the world, so we won't see anything about them just yet. For now, our focus will be the continent called Nivah. Please excuse the low-quality hand drawn maps, I haven't digitized of these maps just yet.</p>

          <p>At the time of our setting, the year is 1510 P.D. (Post Divergence). Although it is set in your typical high-fantasy setting, I wanted to explore the concept of magic not as a mythical concept but a studied science. Essentially, the question of this worldbuild is how would a world with magic exist? How might it progress? How would it look differently from our world? Its these questions that drive a lot of what I write in this world: a mix between the mythical aspects of high-fantasy and the gritty reality of the modern age.   </p>

          <p>There are five distinct regions in Nivah:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Adyaerion Steppe</li>
            <li>The Westerlands</li>
            <li>The Highlands & Shattered Isles</li>
            <li>The Et'Valoriat Penninsula</li>
            <li>The Reach</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Adyaerion Steppe</h3>
          <p>Encompassing the central and northern regions of the continent, the Adyaerion steppe is a vast expanse of rolling plains and flat land inspired by the topograhpy of Mongolia. This region is home to the Adyaerion Empire, an declining kingdom which has existed for nearly a millennium. The empire is ruled by the Adyaerion family, a proud and noble house which traces its lineage back to the earliest human settlers in Nivah. The Adyaerions rule their kingdom with an iron fist, utilzing fear and military might to command their subjects. At one point in time the Adyaerions ruled over all of Nivah, but as their power declined they eventually lost control over the regions of the continent. In Nivah, the Adyaerion kingdom is the largest collection of humans. It has a population of roughly 1.4 million and the people of Adyair practice a monoltry relgion known as the Faith of Primordial. The capital city of the empire is called Estone and is inspired by the Lord of the Rings city Minas Tirith. It sits on a massive mountain called Trueheart, reaching nearly four thousand feet in hieght. The peope of Adyair practice many livlihoods but the region is most popular for its advanced agricultural techniques.</p>

          <h3>The Highlands & Shattered Isles</h3>
          <p>The Highlands are the southeastern part of the continent. Fringing on the borders with the Adyaerions and the Red Mountains, these open plains are home to a collection of city-states that claim dominion over the land. These city-states have allied to form a defense pact against northern aggression. For centuries, the Adyaerions ruled over the Highlands with an iron fist. After the decline of the empire, the Highlands were able to break away from their imperial rulers, with the cities on the coast becoming their own free territories. The region has seen some success since its independence, as wishful and inspired constituencies have begun to form the makings of a constitutional republic. This region is inspired by the highlands of Scotland with its soaring rocky cliffs and endless rolling hills. The history and politics of the Highlands mirror the struggle faced by the Irish under British imperialism. In many ways they also mirror the United States in their effort to become a more democratic polity which is concerned with the representation and civil liberties that we're never afforded under their previous rulers. New to their independce the Highlands strives to create their own safe haven for the oppressed, stretching the boundaries of self-goverence and the pursuit of happiness. Located to the southereast of the Highlands is an area known as the Shattered Isles. As the name suggests, the Shattered Isles is a collection of sparse islands which was the result of a massive conflict during the Age of Gods. Now, it is home to a variety of Merfolk, an aquatic species of humaniods which live on the islands and beneath the waves in sprawling underwater cities. Those who are human and live in the Shattered Isles are referred to as "Nomain", named after the coastline. The Nomain people are a seafaring tribal community which live in and around the Merfolk in semi-cooperative communities. The region is home to all manner of mythical creatures and is rather untouched by all the commotion caused by recent technological advancements. </p>

          <h3>The Westerlands</h3>
          <p>Located in the most western reaches of Nivah, the Westerlands are a collection of city-states that have formed an alliance to bolster their military and economic resources. Referred to as the “Westland Federation,” the governing body of this federation consists of several legislatures that comprise a grand assembly. Basically, the Westerland Federation is the first fully democractic government in Terra. Situated against a large mountain range, the Westerlands experience a life isolated from the rest of the continent. Though they are the smallest in landmass and population, the Westerlands are incredibly industrial and affluent. Due to their close proximity to lucrative gold mines, cultural homogeneity, and industrial society, the Westerlands are a powerful hegemony that demonstrates its power through its economic influence, safeguarding its valuable exports and political interests. The region is famous for its technological advancements which are mostly afforded to the Westerland's history with the dwarves. Yes, these are the same mythical race of humaniod as Gimily from Lord of the Rings or say Brok and Shindri from the God of War series. The dwarves are famous for their ingenuity, engineering, and hardworking attitude. Unsurpriningly, the Westerlands is the home of Power, the magic technology mentioned earlier. It was invented and developed in the city of Genoa which is by far one of the most successful cities in the world.</p>

          <h3>The Et'Valoriat Penninsula</h3>
          <p>Commonly referred to as the Valorian Penninsula, this region of Nivah is located to the southeast, right next to the Shattered Isles. Et'Valoriat is a nation-state of elves which maintains a constant level of isolation and secrecy from the rest of the continent. The people of Et'Valoriat are ruled by a theocratic council of elders who claim privelege in their soceity by a divine mandate. This council claims to speak the will of their god, Selene. Valorians are incredibly devout and live under a strict social code. Inspired by the culture of Japan, this area was actually written by a friend who wanted to contribute to Terra. As I integrated their work into the world, I wanted to invite some of the mythical aspects of the world back into the setting. Its easily one of my favorite places in Terra so far.  </p>

          <h3>The Reach</h3>
          <p>Located in the northeast Nivah, the Reach is the ancient homeland of the Orcish tribes of Jah'Um. The Reach is a dry, cold place with a with a wide-open plain running through the center. Its periphery is ringed by tall mountains known as Bane's Grip. The Jah'Um live in tribal communities under a socio-religious hierarchy where the oldest orcs rule as elders. At the top of this hierarchy is the "chieftain", a leader who is chosen but popular demand of the tribe. Depending on which kind of tribe you are born into determines what lifestyle you lead. There are pastoral nomadic trips which move in large caravans referred to as hordes. There are tribes that live in sprawling cities dug within the side of mountain faces. And some tribes live as warriors, selling their skills in warfare to those with money or who are scary enough to command respect. In the Reach, respect is the only currency. Money is of little value and the only way to garner respect among your peers is to prove yourself through "labors". Once an orc youngling as done enough labors, they are accepted as adults by their tribe and granted privileges such as being able to marry, own land, and practice skills of your choosing. The tribes worship the god Gruumsh, an orc referred to as the "Eternal Chieftain". The Jah'Um thrive because of their collective efforts to the tribe. Individuality is not emphasized much in orcish life, the tribe is what matters. The tribe must continue. The tribe must thrive. The Jah'Um are famous for their food, smithing, and weapons. </p>
