For my web page I have developed an interactive website which explores my creative writing project Terra Inter, or, The Lands Between. I mentioned this project at the beginning of the semester and its been on my mind since. So, this is a full tilt at creating a space for myself and those interested to browse and add entries, maps, and documents wrriten for this project. I run a Dungeons and Dragons game with several friends. A larger hope for this project is to provide my players an interactive environment to explore and learn about the world before reaching the table. 

Here's the link to the project: {enter link here}
