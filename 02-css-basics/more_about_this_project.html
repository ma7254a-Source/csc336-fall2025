        <h2>More About Terra</h2>
        <p>Here is some of the entries I have written about Terra that are more about the world rather than a single continent.</p>

        <section class="subsection">
          <h2>Religion</h2>
          <p>Religion in Terra, in any high-fantasy setting, always seem complex. And the truth is that it is difficult writing religion in any setting. That is, faith that you write yourself. The essence of religion, at least in a worldbuilding project, is to tell a story. This story can be the classic creation story of the world or at least of the faith you are writing about. It can also be a moral in of itself. For me, religion is a tool to answer the age of question of existence. It solves the problems of thinking about how the world came to be, at least from a theological standpoint, and acts as a vehicle which might explain some of the wonder or magic of the world. The gods in Terra range from good to evil and regardless of their stories, there is meant to be a story wrapped up in all of it. At the end of the day, its about how cultures view their place in a much, much larger story. One where that culture isn't really sure where exactly they fit in this ever growing story. </p>
          <p>There are many, many religions in Terra. Some faiths stretch as far as the world spans. Others exist as local beliefs carried on by years of tradition. Mainly, ever one of these followings falls into these four categories.</p>

          <h3>The Primoridal Faith</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Monolatry religion which worships a God referred to as “The Creator”. This being is considered the one true god and responsible for the creation of the universe, other gods, and in control of every aspect of life. Below him are minor deities which are considered canon figures in world story but not on the same level of worship and reverence as The Creator. </li>
            <li>Currently the largest religion in the world and also the oldest living religion. Due to increasing efforts by the Primordial Church, missionaries have turned the majority of the world towards the Primordial Faith.</li>
            <li>Believed that The Creator separates pieces of his power into fragments which are honed by all living creatures. This power is what theologians consider magic.</li>
            <li>The Creator is a physical manifestation of the naturally occurring magic in the world. Similar to the Holy Spirit in Christianity, The Creator is believed to exist in all will, action, and thought.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Olympic Faith</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Polytheistic religion which worships beings called Embodiments and Aspects which represent features of human life.</li>
            <li>Believes in a balance of these features, a Yin and Yang relationship. For every good there is a mirrored bad. Both are required for the safety and security of the world. </li>
            <li>Aspects are considered positive features while Embodiments are considered negative.</li>
            <li>Is the second largest religion behind the Primordial Faith. The Olympic Faith and the Primordial Faith are two sides of the same coin. These two followings share a similar to relationship to Christianity and Protestantism. The Olympic Faith is simply an offshoot of the Primordial Faith the same way Protestantism is an offshoot of Catholicism. Same religion, different rules.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Natural Gods</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Deities and powers which represent the forces of nature. </li>
            <li>Very little formal worship aside from small traditions like marriage, birth, and death.</li>
            <li>Wind, Fire, Earth, Water, Death, and Life are the largest examples.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Dark Ones</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Religion which worships the demons and dark entities of the universe. </li>
            <li>At its center is one being called The Dark, Deimos, or Heidon which is considered a singular manifestation of the Abyss and its dark energy.</li>
            <li>onsidered a heretical faith, it is often only seen on the edges of the world.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Gods of Terra</h2>
          <p>I will comment that this section is incomplete. Here is a simple list of the most important gods of Terra</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Creator:</li>
            <p>Ultimate God of creation and the universe. Is the arch-god of the Primordial faith and is believed to be a manifestation of all worldly energies. Referred to with many different names and displayed in various ways. The Creator is the only god which has never been seen by anyone other than the True Born gods. Moradin and Torm are the only two which can say they have held conversation with The Creator.</p>
            <li>Torm the True:</li>
            <p>True born god and God-King, Torm is the principality of justice, honor, and righteousness. His icon is an armored paladin in front of a silver dragon. He presided over the territory that is presently the Adyaerion Steppe. The capital city of Adyair, Estone, was once known as the powerful fortress city Trueheart, where Torm sat his marble throne.</p>
            <li>Moradin, the Elder Hammer:</li>
            <p>True-born God-King of the dwarves. Considered to be the creator of the dwarven people  and the manifestation behind the energies of creativity, ingenuity, and enchanting. As God-King he ruled over the areas presently known as the Dwilik Mountains in Originius but also held domains in Nivah, Valoria, and New Haven in the form of autonomous but loyal dwarven underground holds. Like many others, Moradin resides in the ancient city of Aguul, occupying his seat as Title of Creation. </p>
            <li>Corellon, the One Arrow</li>
            <p>True-Born God-King of the elves. Much like Moradin, Correlon is said to be the creator of the elf and a manifestation of the mythical nature of elven kind. Corellon is known as an honest, kind ruler who led the elves to freedom from the tyranny of Tiamat during the Age of Chaos. Corellon presently does not reside on the material plane, having moved to the Feywild to support the endless wars of the domain. In his stead, the Title of Pride, Ghirahim, occupies his seat in the ancient city of Aguul. </p>
            <li>Apollo, God of Light</li>
            <p>True-born God-King of the sun, Apollo is the god of light, love, and life. Unlike Moradin and Corellon, he is not the creator of a mythical race. Instead, it is written that he is more like a force of nature, a manifestation of personality and emotion. He is said to share a close connection to Nero, King of the Underworld, and that their energies are in constant battle. Apollo for his efforts in the Second War of the Great Ones has been banished from the Material Plane. It's believed that he has returned to his celestial domain of Sol, which is thought to literally be the Sun. </p>
            <li>Nero, King of the Underworld</li>
            <p>Much like Apollo, Nero is a true born God-King and ruler of the underworld. With his magic powers, he presses the natural forces of death to maintain a balance over the natural world. He leads the souls of the damned and the remains of their person to the underworld. Many mistake Nero for a malign god, one of evil. In reality, Nero is considered a benign and merciful god, one which saves many lost souls from oblivion. His following is large and not uncommon or frowned upon. Like Apollo is God of light, Nero is the keeper of darkness; for there can never be one without the other. </p>
            <li>The Raven Queen, Death's Consort</li>
            <li>Bane, the Endless Tyrant</li>
            <li>Bhaal, Chaos Manifest</li>
            <li>Gruumsh, the Eternal Cheiftain</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>World History of Terra</h2>
          <p>The world history of Terra can be separated into several ages. Each age is defined, unsurprisingly, by its name. The amount of time in each age varies depending on how recent it was. Older ages were incredibly long either because no one was around to take an accurate account of what was happening or because nothing was really going on. The most recent ages are better accounted for in writings, text, and culture and as a result cover a more comprehensive timeline.</p>

          <h3>Age of Creation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Considered the beginning of all time.</li>
            <li>Prior to this age, the Material Plane did not exist. A massive transfer of magic into the empty space between nothing and reality caused the creation of a new plane. This is believed to have been the result of the gods moving through the planar realms.</li>
            <li>Once the plane was created, the gods bent magic, light, and Will to make the world, the sky, and the stars. They named this place, Terra.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Era of Gods/Age of Gods</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>After the creation of the Material Plane, the gods inhabited Terra.</li>
            <li>They molded the world to their desire and made themselves homes. They raised life from the bosom of Terra and made life to support the world they crafted. Tired from their work, they rested for a long, long time.</li>
            <li>Then one day a lanky, gray creature emerged from the bushes.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Primordial Age</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Period marked by the introduction of the first humanoid.</li>
            <li>Referred to as Primordial humans, these creatures were the basis for the “big three”: humans, dwarves, and elves.</li>
            <li>Marked by the use of tools, culture, and language.</li>
            <li>The gods claimed rule over these strange creatures and named them “Humans.”</li>
            <li>From there, they created the first humanoid societies.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Age of Monsters</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Marked by the emergence of powerful magic creatures like dragons taking control of the surface world.</li>
            <li>Resulted in the enslavement of primordial humans, causing an event called the “Great Schism,” in which primordial humans split into elves, dwarves, and humans.</li>
            <li>Those that became elves fled to a mysterious land called the Feywild. Dwarves fled underground and evolved into a subterranean race. Humans remained on the surface either enslaved or fighting against the oppression of the monsters.</li>
            <li>Modern scientists argue that the Age of Monsters was actually a period of great weather phenomenon which drove primordial humans into major evolutionary changes—the creation of “monsters” was merely the result of fear and imagination.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Age of Chaos/Storms</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>After the Age of Monsters, the surviving populations reclaim the surface. Years of isolation and hardship create tensions between communities over resources, leading to large-scale conflicts.</li>
            <li>Eventually the conflicts are resolved through pacts, agreements, and partnerships. Communities evolve into societies with culture and adopt religion and traditions.</li>
            <li>Kingdoms emerge, fall, and evolve. Ministries become institutions. Life continues in a semi-harmonious state with both the mortal and divine living together.</li>
            <li>Historians consider the first half of the age as a prelude to the larger events of the Age of Chaos.</li>
            <li>The two major events which actually encapsulate the Age of Chaos are the first and second War of the Great Ones, a global conflict between two factions of the Olympian Faith.</li>
            <li>At the end of the second war, massive reforms changed the Olympian church and the perceived need of the divine on the Material Plane.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Era of Man/Age of Divergence/Post Divergence</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Marked by massive religious reforms for the Olympian Faith including but not limited to:
              <ul>
                <li>Removal of several divine entities from the Material Plane</li>
                <li>Seclusion of the Olympian Council to the city of Aguul.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Many other churches, such as the Apollionic Church, were branded heretical and disbanded. After 3,000 years of uncontested control, the Olympian Church was reduced to a scattered church constantly at odds with the fractured remains of its ministry. On the other hand, the Primordial Church would see massive increases in their church and influence.</li>
            <li>Advances in technology, spurred on by the recent conflicts, birthed a new era of technology and industry—specifically, the emergence of magic infused technology called Power.</li>
            <li>Societies are moving past monarchies into more democratic forms of government.</li>
            <li>The industrial revolution has brought on changes in considerations of labor, wages, and the class system.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h2>Major Historical Events</h2>
          <p>The periods above timeline Terra’s world history in broad strokes. Within these periods, there are specific events which are relevant to understanding world history. Moreover, these events would be common knowledge for people living in the era.</p>

          <h3>The Queen’s Reign</h3>
          <p>During the Age of Monsters, Dragon-God Tiamat ruled the lands which are presently the Dwilik mountains; some of the plains of the west and the sea to the east were considered her domain. It was here that the dragon queen launched several offensive campaigns against the other gods in hopes of one day controlling the world. The conflict ultimately ends with Tiamat vanquished and the establishment of the Olympian Council.</p>

          <h3>First War of the Great Ones</h3>
          <p>The War of the Great Ones was a global conflict which started within the Olympian Faith. The war started after the Embodiment of War, Maralo, murders the Embodiment of Pride. Maralo was enraged after Hybris, the title Pride, made some inappropriate remarks towards Maralo’s wife. The slight resulted in a confrontation on the steps of Mount Olympus, the great hall which the Olympian Council met in.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“And then the Warrior King smote Pride with fire and fury, burning him into nothing. The ashes swept from the steps as though they were being carried. Clouds and sorrow gathered above the city, growing like a great storm.” – The Book of Silver</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>After the murder Maralo fled the city of Aguul to his homeland. Maralo ruled over the lands which comprise the modern Chechik Desert. Soon after this incident, the Olympian Council declared his actions criminal and revoked his position on the council. Maralo, within the security of his own land, begins to raise an army. As tensions between the War and the Council continue to escalate, the Council is forced to raise an army of their own and attempts to bring Maralo to justice.</p>

          <h3>The Great Collapse</h3>
          <p>A series of catastrophic events which lead to the abandonment of several ancient dwarven holds. Those who survive flee to the Dwilik Mountains. The collapse also affected several city-holds in the Dwilik mountains such as the ancient Dwarven city of Amberfell and the Amberfell Citadel. Despite it being a well-documented event, the true nature of the catastrophes remains largely unknown.</p>

          <h3>Second War of the Great Ones</h3>
          <p>The Second War of the Great Ones was Terra’s second global conflict caused by a massive schism in the Olympian Faith. After the First War of the Great Ones, Maralo is excommunicated and banished from the Material Plane. After Maralo’s banishment, the council rushes to replace him hoping to limit the damages to their reputation and authority. The council elects a new title, a blood demon named Abarax (Ab-R-axe).</p>
          <p>Hailing from the darkness of the Abyssal Plane, Abarax is a powerful blood demon summoned to the Material Plane during the Age of Monsters. His summoner, a dark magician named Sullivan, tried to bind Abarax to his will. Sullivan wanted to make Abarax his familiar, a strange process which had never been done before. Typically, demons are summoned from the Abyss to complete the will or task of the summoner. Afterwards, they must return to the Abyss or risk a misalignment from the Abyssal powers which they rely on. For Abarax, Sullivan’s magic prevented him from returning and, unsurprisingly, Abarax retaliated. He murders Sullivan and tries to return to the Abyss, hoping Sullivan’s death would nullify the magic keeping him. Unfortunately, Sullivan’s magic would not vanquish and Abarax was now permanently bound to the Material Plane.</p>
          <p>Despite the setback, Abarax would absorb Sullivan’s lands and titles. Abarax would continue to rule over Sullivan’s domain until the Olympian Council invited him to the high city of Aguul. There Abarax was informed that the council intended him to take the mantle of War. Abarax refused the council but the Olympians did not allow it. Instead, they imbued Abarax with the title of War and remanded him to the city of Aguul.</p>
          <p>Abarax, enraged by the council’s actions, escapes Aguul and raises an army of occult followers and demon spawn. Abarax declares war against the Olympian Council and starts a massive total-war campaign against anyone who stands in his way. Reports indicate he was searching for something within the Council’s possession but it is never specified what Abarax was looking for.</p>

          <h3>Reign of the Unifier</h3>
          <p>A 6-month war between two major factions on the continent of New Haven, an isolated continent to the southeast. The winners, House Barbossa, unify the continent under their control. They become the second monarchy to establish control over an entire continent. The reigning monarch, Lionel Barbossa II, takes the title of “Grand Unifier” after his success. Although the conflict itself was rather short, the success of House Barbossa transformed them into a major player in global exports as the largest producer and refiner of Soul Gems. Likewise, the conflict would be the last major discourse within the realm. House Barbossa rules today with the longest period of peace, 427 years.</p>

          <h3>The Telic Wars</h3>
          <p>The Telic Wars were a collection of offensive campaigns launched by the Telic Empire. These campaigns were geared towards expanding territorial claims either by military occupation or diplomatic strong-arming. As they owned the world’s largest navy, their ability to transport troops and supplies abroad was unparalleled. This allowed them to maintain a strong war effort thousands of kilometers from home.</p>
          <p>Separated into 5 different theatres, the Telics remained at constant odds with other kingdoms, indigenous populations, and the challenges of colonization. Eventually, the long-term conflict destabilizes the Telic economy, toppling the Telic war machine. The end of the Telic wars would come after the advent of the Astoran Rebellion with all major forces being recalled to defend the homeland. Despite efforts to return to Originis, the forces overseas would not make it in time to save Emperor Telic. The troops who were still overseas would abandon their posts or mutiny. Many of the veterans, now without pay, would turn towards piracy. This transition ushered in the formation of the Pirate Syndicate.</p>

          <h3>Invention of Power</h3>
          <p>1345 P.D., Arch Mage Kenji Lamez successfully tests the first magic-infused device. Powered by a Soul Gem Catalyst, Alt is able to power a simple light. This tiny invention would begin Terra’s first industrial revolution.</p>

          <h3>The Astoran Rebellion</h3>
          <p>The Astoran Rebellion was an armed conflict during the Age of Post-Divergence. The Astoran family, pledged to the Telic family, attempted to arrest Emperor Telic in hopes of forcing his abdication. However, the Astorans failed to arrest Emperor Telic thus plunging the country into a civil war. Broadly speaking, the southeastern half of the Telic Empire would declare for the Astoran family while the northern half remained loyal to the Telics. This conflict would ultimately result in the Astoran ascension to royalty and the end of the Telic Dynasty.</p>

          <h3>Spring of the Golden Executioner</h3>
          <p>The spring of 1516 P.D. marked the end of the Astoran Rebellion and the beginning of the Astoran Inquisition’s surveillance state. Known as the “Bloody Spring” or the “Executioner’s March”, Grand Inquisitor Holden Cross would take 2,500 paladins and 7,000 Astoran soldiers across the southern regions of Astora and conduct mass executions of Astoran dissidents. By the time spring ended, over 40,000 people had been killed or imprisoned by the church. As the summer started, the Inquisition began a 3-month siege at the city of Stargate, the last remaining holdout of Telic loyalists. After the city falls, Grand Inquisitor Holden Cross returns to the capital, now named Astora, to witness the ascension of Marcus Astoran VI to the throne, ending the Bloody Spring.</p>

          <h3>The War of Wind and Clouds</h3>
          <p>The War of Wind and Clouds was a short-term conflict between the newly emerging Astoran military and the Eastern Pirate Clans. Several of the clans banded together and attacked the city of Portamento. After the sacking of Portamento, the pirate clans began a 4-week raiding campaign on the northern coast of Astora. Eventually, the Astorans were forced to respond as pirate contingents threatened the security and authority of the Astoran monarchy.</p>

          <h3>The Cordis Die Insurgency</h3>
          <p>Comprising several small raids on Astoran military infrastructure, the Cordis Die pirate group has stirred civil unrest in Astora, breaking the surveillance state of the Astoran Inquisition and undermining the authority of the Astoran military. As a result, several small towns have refused to pay land and crop taxes. Rumors are circulating that the new city of Ozark is readying to rebel against the crown.</p>
