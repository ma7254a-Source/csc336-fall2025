                Obviously this is a hw assignemnt but the words used come from my word-wall. My word-wall includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Passages from my favorite books</li>
                <li>Quotes from media or people I know</li>
                <li>The definitions of words that I want to remember or draw some sort of meaning beyond the definition</li>
                <li>Sometimes a drawing, doodle, or sketch will make it on there. Sometimes its notes from a retired journal or a grocery list.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
